subtitle: Finding the inner strength and motivation you need to face life’s challenges.
---
A lover of the outdoors and being active, my passion for horses is where it started. At high school I was selected to train with my then idol, Sally Gunnell, at Crystal Palace athletics track, over hurdles. Camilla Cresswell PT was born out of my sporting childhood. In my teens the spin studio (in LA Fitness) was where I could be found, exerting energy to loud music in back to back spin classes, beat that.  This led to a hunger for strength training. In 2003, I completed my Level 2 Fitness Instructor qualification.

Post having a baby in 2015, facing the physical and mental challenges that followed becoming a mother I developed new found strength exercising racehorses. Doing something I loved was completely empowering and it hit home how closely linked are physical and mental health. Loving fitness and being around people, it was a no brainer I had to help and inspire others.

As a qualified Level 3 Personal Trainer, I'm passionate about helping you find the inner strength and motivation needed to face life’s challenges.

Not only as an Age Group Triathlete I might just inspire you to Swim, Bike and Run but I will advise on how to fit training sessions in life's busy schedule. Yes it is possible! I provide inspiration and changes to your fitness programming to help you achieve your goals

## Qualifications

* Certified Level 3 Personal Trainer
* Certified Pre and Post Natal Personal Trainer
* A member of The Chartered Institute for the Management of Sport and Physical Activity
* Age Group Triathlete for Great Britain

## Philosophy & Motivation

Fitness is essential for emotional and physical stamina and for overall health and
wellbeing. My motivation to exercise is to feel great about myself, not so much for
the physical benefits, they’re an added bonus! It’s about feeling happy and energised
on the inside as much as the outside. Being active and breaking into a sweat is really
important for the mind, body and soul. An active life improves sleep quality, cognitive
function and lowers risks of mental illness. Fitness should be fun, setting realistic
goals will encourage you to stay motivated and build on your confidence and self
esteem.

## Approach

I thrive on being outdoors, and very happy to train you outside of a gym environment come rain or shine. I will help you find your strengths. My positive, upbeat and energetic persona will encourage and motivate you. 

In my private boutique gym we'll start with a consultation where we will discuss your goals, current fitness levels and nutrition. I will then design a bespoke programme to help you on your fitness journey.

Change in a fitness programme is key to adaption and I am here to make that happen for you.
