I’m Camilla; mother, triathlete, horsewoman, business owner and PT. Life is busy! I know I am not alone in feeling the pressures of modern life; working, raising a family, and taking care of a home can often mean that fitness takes a back seat for many.

What if I told you I could help you to feel motivated, to actually want to work hard? Imagine feeling stronger than ever, both physically and mentally so that you are ready to face all of life’s challenges head on.

The good news is that this is entirely possible! My love of fitness combined with a desire to help and inspire will ensure that you are on track to discovering an inner-strength which will impact all areas of your life positively.

## Background

My childhood, which was filled with sport and outdoor adventures,
most significantly involving horses, is really where it all began.
At school, I was thrilled to be selected to train with one of my
idols, Sally Gunnell, at Crystal Palace athletics track.
As well as horses and hurdles, I discovered a love for spinning
and spent much of my teen years sweating it out in the spin
studio! This inspired me to build on my own strength and I went
on to complete my Level 2 Fitness Instructor qualification.

However, it wasn’t until I became a mother myself in 2015 that I
realised the absolute necessity of exercise for mental well-being
as well as physical. I began exercising racehorses and was struck
not only by my new-found strength but also how empowered it
made me feel. Movement really is medicine; I went on to qualify
as a Level 3 PT with the hope of sharing this message far and
wide.

## Qualifications

- Certified Level 3 Personal Trainer
- Certified Pre and Post Natal Personal Trainer
- A member of The Chartered Institute for the Management of Sport and Physical Activity
- Age Group Triathlete for Great Britain

## Philosophy & Motivation

Fitness is essential for emotional and physical stamina and for overall health and
wellbeing. My motivation to exercise is to feel great about myself, not so much for
the physical benefits, they’re an added bonus! It’s about feeling happy and energised
on the inside as much as the outside. Being active and breaking into a sweat is really
important for the mind, body and soul. An active life improves sleep quality, cognitive
function and lowers risks of mental illness. Fitness should be fun, setting realistic
goals will encourage you to stay motivated and build on your confidence and self
esteem.

## Approach

I thrive on being outdoors, and very happy to train you outside of a gym environment come rain or shine. I will help you find your strengths. My positive, upbeat and energetic persona will encourage and motivate you.

In my private boutique gym we'll start with a consultation where we will discuss your goals, current fitness levels and nutrition. I will then design a bespoke programme to help you on your fitness journey.

Change in a fitness programme is key to adaption and I am here to make that happen for you.
