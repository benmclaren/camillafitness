I take intimate boutique style classes 8-10 people in Shipston-on-Stour, they last 45 min tops, easy to fit into your day. High impact cardio vascular and strength based, open to all levels of fitness. A great way to increase your fitness and release those endorphins, or even to top up on your 1-1 sessions with me. A total body blast that will leave you feeling invigorated for the day ahead.
