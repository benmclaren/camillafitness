Camilla will create a custom programme taking into consideration both of your current levels of
fitness. You are guarenteed to see positive results with the added benefit of having a fitness buddy to train with.

Achieving fitness goals takes time, however working alongside a motivated Camilla and your buddy, who will
make you put that extra bit of effort in when you feel as though you canâ€™t go that step
further, will increase your chances of reaching your goals quickly. No one works as hard on
their own as they do when there is someone standing beside them encouraging and pushing
them.

Camilla has an enthusiasm for life, her positive outlook is infectious and you will leave your
sessions with her feeling invigorated, upbeat and ready to take on what the world throws at
you!
