Camilla can create a bespoke programme taking into
consideration your unique birthing experience, pelvic floor
weaknesses, diastasis recti (separation of abdominal muscles)
and postural imbalances.

Most importantly she will help you regain your core strength
before progressing your programme to include weight
resistance training and cardiovascular work. Having been in
your shoes she fully empathises with how consuming each day
can feel, and will welcome you with a smiley, friendly face and
listen to any concerns you may have. Regaining your physical
strength will help you through the sleepless nights and give
YOU something to look forward to!
