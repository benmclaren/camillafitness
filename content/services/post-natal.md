I can create a bespoke programme taking into consideration your unique birthing
experience, pelvic floor weaknesses, diastasis recti (separation of abdominal muscles) and
postural imbalances. 

I will help you regain your core strength most importantly, before
progressing your programme to include weights and cardiovascular work.
Having been in your shoes I fully empathise how consuming each day can feel, and willÂ 
welcome you with a smiley, friendly face who will listen to any concerns you may have.
Regaining your physical strength will help you through the sleepless nights and give you
something for YOU to look forward to!
