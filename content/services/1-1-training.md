Camilla will create a bespoke programme taking into consideration your current level of
fitness. The most desirable benefit of personal training is the fact you’re guaranteed to see
positive results due to taking affective sessions tailored to you and your needs.
Achieving fitness goals takes time, however working alongside a motivated Camilla, who will
make you put that extra bit of effort in when you feel as though you can’t go that step
further, will increase your chances of reaching your goals quickly. No one works as hard on
their own as they do when there is someone standing beside them encouraging and pushing
them.
Camilla has an enthusiasm for life, her positive outlook is infectious and you will leave your
sessions with her feeling invigorated, upbeat and ready to take on what the world throws at
you!
