Pregnancy is an exciting time, however for many women the physiological, psychological
and biomechanical changes occur during pre and postnatal periods can cause anxiety.Â 
Physical activity can help keep expectant mothers feeling physically and mentally strong. I
am able to offer safe exercise to expectant mothers who wish to maintain their fitness
throughout their pregnancy and can offer exceptional postpartum training after birth.
I understand the considerations and modifications that must be applied when designing a
programme of physical activity for each individual trimester. Taking into account your
energy levels, previous levels of fitness and any pregnancy related issues you may have.
I can also offer nutritional advice as well as dietary and supplementation needs.
