Pregnancy is an exciting time, however for many women the
physiological, psychological and biomechanical changes that
occur during pre and postnatal periods can cause anxiety.Â 

Physical activity can help keep expectant mothers feeling
physically and mentally strong. Camilla is able to offer safe
exercise to mums to be who wish to maintain their fitness
throughout their pregnancy and can offer exceptional
postpartum training after the birth. She understands the
considerations and modifications that must be applied when
designing a programme of physical activity for each individual
trimester. This takes into account energy levels, previous levels
of fitness and any pregnancy related health issues you may
have. She can also offer nutritional advice as well as dietary
and supplementation needs.
