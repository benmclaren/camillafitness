I have always been a lover of the outdoors and being active. An obsession with horses is where it all started, followed by being selected, at school, to train with my then idol, Sally Gunnell, at Crystal Palace athletics track, over hurdles. Yes- I LOVE to jump! Camilla Cresswell PT was born out of my sporting childhood. Later into my teens I was able to finally join a gym where I became a ‘spin’ fanatic- especially on colder darker nights- participating in back to back classes in what became my 2nd home at LA Fitness in South London. In 2003, I completed my Level 2 Fitness Instructor qualification. 

Post having had a baby in 2015, and facing the physical and mental challenges that
followed I threw myself into exercising racehorses, feeling a new-found strength by
being physically active everyday and throwing myself into something I loved was
completely empowering. It really hit home and was a reminder how closely linked
physical and mental health are. Loving people and fitness, it was a no brainer I had
to follow my heart to help and inspire others.

I am now a qualified Level 3 Personal Trainer, and I am passionate about helping
you find the inner strength, motivation and power you need to face life’s challenges.
I have the understanding &amp; knowledge for athletes who need a change in
programming, and empathy for those stuck working at a desk who need motivation,
enthusiasm and positive energy. I can provide inspiration and change to your fitness
programming to help you achieve your goals.

## Qualifications
- Certified Level 3 Personal Trainer
- Certified Pre and Post Natal Personal Trainer

## Philosophy & Motivation
Fitness is essential for emotional and physical stamina and for overall health and
wellbeing. My motivation to exercise is to feel great about myself, not so much for
the physical benefits, they’re an added bonus! It’s about feeling happy and energised
on the inside as much as the outside. Being active and breaking into a sweat is really
important for the mind, body and soul. An active life improves sleep quality, cognitive
function and lowers risks of mental illness. Fitness should be fun, setting realistic
goals will encourage you to stay motivated and build on your confidence and self
esteem.

## Approach
I thrive on being outdoors, I am more than happy to train you outside of a gym environment come rain or shine. I will also inspire and help you find what you enjoy. My positive, upbeat and energetic persona will encourage and motivate you. 
 
We’ll start with a consultation where we will discuss your goals, current fitness levels and nutrition. I will then design a bespoke programme to help you on your fitness journey.

We all need a shake up in our fitness routine to make change happen, I am here to do just that for you!.
