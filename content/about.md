I have always been a lover of the outdoors and being active. An obsession with horses is where it all started, followed by being selected, at school, to train with my then idol, Sally Gunnell, at Crystal Palace athletics track, over hurdles. Yes- I LOVE to jump! Camilla Cresswell PT was born out of my sporting childhood. Later into my teens I was able to finally join a gym where I became a ‘spin’ fanatic- especially on colder darker nights- participating in back to back classes in what became my 2nd home at LA Fitness in South London. In 2003, I completed my Level 2 Fitness Instructor qualification. 

Post having had a baby in 2015, and facing the physical and mental challenges that followed I threw myself into exercising racehorses, feeling a new-found strength by being physically active everyday and throwing myself into something I loved was completely empowering and it really hit home quite how closely linked physical and mental health are

I am now a qualified Level 3 Personal Trainer, and I am passionate about helping you find the inner strength, motivation and power you need to face lifes challenges. I have the understanding and empathy for those stuck at a desk who need motivation, enthusiasm and positive energy. I can provide inspiration and change to your fitness progamming to help you achieve your goals.

## Qualifications
- Certified Level 3 Personal Trainer
- Certified pre and post natal personal trainer

## Philosophy
Fitness is essential for emotional and physical stamina and for overall health and wellbeing. It’s about feeling great on the inside as much as the outside. Being active and breaking into a sweat is really important for the mind, body and soul. An active life improves sleep quality, cognitive function and lowers risks of mental illness. Fitness should be fun, setting realistic goals will encourage you to stay motivated and build on your confidence and self esteem.

## Approach
I thrive on being outdoors, I am more than happy to train you outside of a gym environment come rain or shine. I will also inspire and help you find what you enjoy. My positive, upbeat and energetic persona will encourage and motivate you. 
 
We’ll start with a consultation where we will discuss your goals, current fitness levels and nutrition. I will then design a bespoke programme to help you on your fitness journey.

We all need a shake up in our fitness routine to make change happen, I am here to do just that for you!.
