  - text: I started training with Camilla in a bid to strengthen my core and lose
      some stubborn post baby fat. In the last few weeks I have already noticed
      a change in my strength, body and mind. Camilla’s classes are energetic,
      flexible and above all fun!! If you want to enjoy working out, Camilla’s
      your lady!!!

  - text: Camilla has trained me for 4 months now and has helped me in so many ways.
      Having had 3 children, I was feeling very self conscious and very aware of
      how much my body had changed. Cami could relate to how I was feeling as
      she has been there herself. She knows the impact that pregnancy can have
      because she has been through it too. Over the last few months she has
      given me so much confidence and has reignited my love of exercise. And it
      helps that we have a laugh too!
