Camilla’s classes are energetic, flexible and above all fun!! If you want to enjoy working out, Camilla’s your lady!!!"

Cami could relate to how I was feeling as she has been there herself. She knows the impact that pregnancy can have because she has been through it too. Over the last few months she has given me so much confidence and has reignited my love of exercise. And it helps that we have a laugh too!"

Before starting the sessions I considered my self to be fit but after the first session I realised I really wasn’t! Today I feel fitter, stronger and happier and that is testament to Camilla’s focussed and tailored training program she has created for me."
