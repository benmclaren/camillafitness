testimonial:
  - text: I started training with Camilla in a bid to strengthen my core and lose
      some stubborn post baby fat. In the last few weeks I have already noticed
      a change in my strength, body and mind. Camilla’s classes are energetic,
      flexible and above all fun!! If you want to enjoy working out, Camilla’s
      your lady!!!

  - text: Camilla has trained me for 4 months now and has helped me in so many ways.
      Having had 3 children, I was feeling very self conscious and very aware of
      how much my body had changed. Cami could relate to how I was feeling as
      she has been there herself. She knows the impact that pregnancy can have
      because she has been through it too. Over the last few months she has
      given me so much confidence and has reignited my love of exercise. And it
      helps that we have a laugh too!

  - text: I have been training with Camilla for over 16 weeks and have honestly
      loved every session. Before starting the sessions I considered my self to
      be fit but after the first session I realised I really wasn’t! Today I
      feel fitter, stronger and happier and that is testament to Camilla’s
      focussed and tailored training program she has created for me.

  - text: Camilla’s sessions are fun, motivational and get the heart rate going! The
      sessions are kept varied and surprisingly an hour of exercising goes
      quickly! I always come out feeling happy and have lacked that sluggish
      feeling since starting.

  - text: Camilla’s sessions are great. Highly recommend! I feel more toned and
      energised. She tailors the session to your needs and corrects you to make
      sure you’re doing the exercises right.

  - text: Camilla is nothing short of AMAZING. From day one she listened carefully
      and subsequently put together a bespoke programme tailored to me, my
      weight loss and fitness goals. She is hugely supportive, motivating me to
      achieve my very best during each PT session yet recognises when minor
      modifications or tweaks are required. Between sessions, she is equally as
      encouraging, keeping in touch with regular comms and positive vibes to
      ensure I’m on track. Thank you so much Camilla.
