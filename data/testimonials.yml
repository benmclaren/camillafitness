  - text: I started training with Camilla when my little boy was 4 months old and I cannot recommend it enough. She has a brilliant undertanding of the challenges facing mums after having had a baby and helped to rebuild my strength and fitness after 9 months of pregnancy. Each session is tailored specifically for you and she is super motivational and enthusiastic - always a joy to spend an hour with!

  - text: I started seeing Camilla as I needed help to reach my goals. I am an active person who exercises 3-5 times a week but still really struggled to get toned. At this point I thought I needed help from a personal trainer, I signed up for a 12 week programme with Camilla and the results are truly remarkable. Camilla offered something extra teaching me new techniques and always pushing me harder, along with always motivating me during and outside from her studio sessions. She's super supportive and the workouts are always engaging and enjoyable.

  - text: Camilla is a great PT. She is motivating and realistic and understands the challenges of motherhood, womanhood, work and general life but encourages you to push yourself harder and the benefits of that speak for themselves. Highly recommend!

  - text: I started training with Camilla in a bid to strengthen my core and lose
      some stubborn post baby fat. In the last few weeks I have already noticed
      a change in my strength, body and mind. Camilla’s classes are energetic,
      flexible and above all fun!! If you want to enjoy working out, Camilla’s
      your lady!!!

      I started seeing Camilla after struggling to make the progress on my own;
      my weight had spiralled, my exercise sporadic and my lifestyle unhealthy
      and unsustainable. My weekly sessions soon saw my fitness improve and then
      came the combined lifestyle changes and healthy eating habits to reinforce
      my effort during the PT sessions.


      Camilla makes the sessions continually challenging and progressive but also provides invaluable motivation and tips to really support you in the long journey. This ranges from recipe ideas, events to sign up too, tools and kit to keep you motivated, gym programs to follow whilst away or in between sessions. Camilla has quite simply the perfect balance to guide you to getting the best results.


      My advice - take the plunge and make the investment in yourself and be super brave and take photos/videos in your first session because regardless of your starting level, your progress will be unrecognisable.

  - text: Camilla has trained me for 4 months now and has helped me in so many ways.
      Having had 3 children, I was feeling very self conscious and very aware of
      how much my body had changed. Cami could relate to how I was feeling as
      she has been there herself. She knows the impact that pregnancy can have
      because she has been through it too. Over the last few months she has
      given me so much confidence and has reignited my love of exercise. And it
      helps that we have a laugh too!

  - text: Camilla is nothing short of AMAZING. From day one she listened carefully
      and subsequently put together a bespoke programme tailored to me, my
      weight loss and fitness goals. She is hugely supportive, motivating me to
      achieve my very best during each PT session yet recognises when minor
      modifications or tweaks are required. Between sessions, she is equally as
      encouraging, keeping in touch with regular comms and positive vibes to
      ensure I’m on track. Thank you so much Camilla.

  - text: I have been training with Camilla for over 16 weeks and have honestly
      loved every session. Before starting the sessions I considered my self to
      be fit but after the first session I realised I really wasn’t! Today I
      feel fitter, stronger and happier and that is testament to Camilla’s
      focussed and tailored training program she has created for me.

  - text: Camilla’s sessions are fun, motivational and get the heart rate going! The
      sessions are kept varied and surprisingly an hour of exercising goes
      quickly! I always come out feeling happy and have lacked that sluggish
      feeling since starting.

  - text: Camilla’s sessions are great. Highly recommend! I feel more toned and
      energised. She tailors the session to your needs and corrects you to make
      sure you’re doing the exercises right.

  - text: I absolutely love training with Camilla, she’s a great motivator and also a fab listener when I chat away! The sessions are always challenging but doable, she tweaks exercises to fit your needs and works towards your overall goals. She’s a great role model and such an advocate for women in sport, I genuinely look forward to my sessions and am feeling stronger with the consistency that I’ve built up with her over the last year
